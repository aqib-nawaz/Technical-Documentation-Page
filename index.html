        <article>
          <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
          <p>A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across 
            other markup languages such as SVG or XML</p>
          <p>Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, 
            for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.
          </p>
          <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color
            and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout
            with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

            You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We
            recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you
            learn further HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth
            between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting
            and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really
            learn CSS without knowing HTML.
          </p>
          <p>Before starting this topic, you should
            also be familiar with using computers and using the web passively
            (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a
            basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software
            and understand how to create and manage files

                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example,
                to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. 
                This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works,
                what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML
              </p>

            <dd>
              <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've
                gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic 
                experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have 
                available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.
              </p>
              <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific 
                disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.

              <p> With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of 
                the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including 
                setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text features. We round off 
                the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.

                and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. 
                Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to 
                the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can 
                now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, 
                and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know abou

        <header>Applying CSS to HTML</header>
        <article>
          <p>There are 3 ways to Apply CSS to HTML:
            <ul>
              <li>External </li>
              <li>Internal</li>
              <li>Inline</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>External CSS</h2>
          <p>
            With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire 
            website by changing just one file!
          </p> 
          <p>Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style 
            sheet file inside the &lt;link&gt; element, inside the head section.
          </p>
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>External styles are defined within the &lt;link&gt; element, inside the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML page:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
              &lt;html&gt;
                &lt;head&gt;
                  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
              &lt;body&gt;
                  &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/body&gt;
              &lt;/html&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension. <br>
            The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.</p>
          <h2>Internal CSS</h2>
          <p>
            An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
          </p> 
          <p>
            The internal style is defined inside the &lt;style&gt; element, inside the head section.
          </p>
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>Internal styles are defined within the &lt;style&gt; element, inside the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML page:</p>
          <pre>
          <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
              &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;style&gt;
                  body {
                    background-color: linen;
                  }
                  h1 {
                    color: maroon;
                    margin-left: 40px;
                  }
                &lt;/style&gt;
              &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;h1>This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
              &lt;p>This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
           </code>
          </pre>

          <h2>Inline Style</h2>
          <p>An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.</p>
          <p>To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.</p>
          <h3>Examle</h3>
          <p>Inline styles are defined within the "style" attribute of the relevant element:</p>
          <pre>
           <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;"&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
              &lt;p style="color:red;"&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;

        <header>How CSS works</header>
        <article>
          <p>We have learned the basics of CSS, what it is for and how to write simple stylesheets. In this lesson we will take a look at how a
            browser takes CSS and HTML and turns that into a webpage.
          </p>
          <h2>How does CSS actually work?</h2>
          <p>
            When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its
            style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've 
            listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens 
            when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).</li>
            <li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory.
              The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.
            </li>
            <li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML 
              document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled 
              bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.</li>
            <li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", 
              e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, 
              and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).</li>
            <li>The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.</li>
            <li>The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).</li>
          </ol>

            provides links to sections of content explaining how to use CSS to solve very common problems when creating a web page.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and their backgrounds; change the size, shape, 
            and position of elements; and add and define borders on elements. 
            But there's not much you can't do once you have a solid understanding of even the basics of CSS. 
            One of the best things about learning CSS is that once you know the fundamentals, usually you have a pretty good 
            feel for what can and can't be done, even if you don't actually know how to do it yet!
